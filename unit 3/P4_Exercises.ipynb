    "You are tasked to develop a basic inventory management system for a store. The system should allow managing the inventory of various products with features like purchasing and restocking items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class called Product:\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. name (str): The name of the product.\n",
    "2. price (float): The price of the product.\n",
    "3. quantity (int): The available quantity of the product in stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. buy(self, amount): This method should:\n",
    "   (a) Reduce the quantity of the product by the given amount if there is enough stock available.\n",
    "   (b) Print the message \"Purchased {amount} of {name}. {remaining_quantity} remaining.\" if the purchase is successful.\n",
    "   (c) Print the message \"Out of stock: Cannot purchase {amount} of {name}. Only {quantity} available.\" if there is not enough stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. restock(self, amount): This method should:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a)Increase the quantity of the product by the given amount.\n",
    "    (b)Print the message \"Restocked {amount} of {name}. New quantity is {quantity}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. display_info(self): This method should:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) Print the product's details in the format: \"Product: {name}, Price: ${price:.2f}, Quantity: {quantity}\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an instance of Product:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an instance named product1 with the name \"Laptop\", price 1500.00, and quantity 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test the display_info() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Call product1.display_info() to show the product details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the buy() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attempt to purchase 3 units of the product using product1.buy(3).\n",
    "    Attempt to purchase 8 units of the product using product1.buy(8) to test the out-of-stock scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test the restock() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Restock 5 units of the product using product1.restock(5).\n",
    "    Call product1.display_info() again to verify the new stock quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additional Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attempt to buy 1 unit after restocking using product1.buy(1) and display the information again.\n",
    "    Try to restock 10 units and display the updated information.\n",
    "Implement the Product class as described, and test all the methods and scenarios mentioned above to ensure the inventory management system works as expected.t's details."
